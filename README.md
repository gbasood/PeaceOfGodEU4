Peace of God
=========
Peace of God is an alternate history modification for Paradox Interactive's Europa Universalis IV.

Description
----

>Beginning with Pope Gregory VII, the Papal State has preached for the violent eviction of Muslims from the holy lands. Religious zeal has taken hold of Europe and for the past 300 years many of Europe's finest have gone to fight and die in the east. Byzantium has only recently begun to lose ground as ambitious Catholic nobles look for new lands to conquer. The Papal focus on the Levant and backlash against the church's violent message means the call for the Albigensian Crusade was not answered and the Cathars of southern France have gathered a sizable following.
